These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of visible light, so they scatter the light in all directions. This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described the phenomenon in the late 19th century.\\n\\nNow, here's the important part: shorter (blue) wavelengths are scattered more than longer (red) wavelengths. This is because the smaller molecules are more effective at scattering the shorter wavelengths. Think of it like a game of pool: the smaller balls (blue light) bounce around more easily than the larger ones (red light).\\n\\nAs a result, when we look up at the sky, our eyes see the scattered blue light more prominently, making the sky appear blue. The color of the sky can vary depending on atmospheric conditions, like pollution, dust, and water vapor, which can scatter light in different ways. But generally, the blue color is due to the scattering of sunlight by tiny molecules in the atmosphere.\\n\\nFun fact: This same principle is why sunsets often appear more orange or red â€“ the longer wavelengths of light have a harder time being scattered, so they reach our eyes with less interference from the shorter wavelengths!\\n\\nSo, there you have it! The sky is blue because of the scattering of sunlight by tiny molecules in the atmosphere.\""
